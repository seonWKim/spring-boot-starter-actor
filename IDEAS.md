# Spring Boot Starter Actor - Use Case Ideas

This document contains use case ideas to showcase the power of combining Spring Boot with the actor model, eliminating the need for external middleware.

## üéØ Target Audience
- **Spring developers** looking for scalable concurrency patterns
- **Actor framework users** (Akka/Pekko) wanting Spring ecosystem benefits
- **Backend engineers** building distributed systems without complex middleware

---

## üí¨ Chat Application Enhancements
*These can be directly added to the `example/chat` module*

### 1. **Online Presence Detection** ‚≠ê High Priority
**Problem:** Traditional solutions require Redis pub/sub or database polling to track online/offline status across cluster nodes.

**Actor Solution:**
- Each user has a `PresenceActor` that tracks their connection state
- Heartbeat mechanism detects disconnections
- Cluster-aware: presence updates propagate automatically across nodes
- No Redis needed for pub/sub

**Value Proposition:**
- Real-time presence without middleware
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections
- Built-in distributed state management

**Implementation Complexity:** Low
**User Appeal:** High (everyone knows "online status" from chat apps)

---

### 2. **Typing Indicators** ‚≠ê High Priority
**Problem:** Showing "User X is typing..." requires coordinating ephemeral state across connections, typically needs Redis with TTL.

**Actor Solution:**
- ChatRoomActor maintains typing state with automatic timeout
- Events broadcast only to room members
- No database or Redis persistence needed

**Value Proposition:**
- Real-time coordination without external pub/sub
- Automatic state cleanup via actor timers
- Efficient: only active typists consume resources

**Implementation Complexity:** Low
**User Appeal:** High (familiar from Slack, Discord, WhatsApp)

---

### 3. **Per-User Rate Limiting** ‚≠ê High Priority
**Problem:** Preventing message spam typically requires Redis counters with expiration or complex in-memory solutions.

**Actor Solution:**
- Each UserActor enforces its own rate limits using token bucket or sliding window
- Distributed automatically via cluster sharding
- No shared state or Redis needed

**Value Proposition:**
- Built-in spam prevention
- Per-user isolation (one spammer doesn't affect others)
- No external rate limiting service needed

**Implementation Complexity:** Low
**User Appeal:** High (practical, addresses real moderation needs)

---

### 4. **Message Read Receipts**
**Problem:** Tracking who read which messages requires complex indexing, typically stored in databases with joins.

- Real-time updates when users read messages
- Query by message ID or user ID efficiently

**Value Proposition:**
- Real-time read tracking without complex queries
- Natural fit for actor state management
- Efficient memory usage (only active conversations)

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium
**User Appeal:** Medium-High (common in messaging apps)

---

### 5. **Private Direct Messages (DMs)**

**Actor Solution:**
- UserActor maintains block/mute list
- Filter messages at actor level before delivery
- Distributed automatically via sharding

**Value Proposition:**
- Client-side filtering without database queries
- Privacy: blocked users don't know they're blocked
