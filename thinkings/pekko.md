# Pekko Configuration

- All configuration is held within the instances of `ActorSystem`
    - This means roughly that the default is to parse all application.conf, application.json and
      application.properties found at the root of the class pathâ€”please refer to the aforementioned
      documentation for details. The actor system then merges in all reference.conf resources found at the root
      of the class path to form the fallback configuration
- As there are a lot of configuration parameters(and also will be added in the future), I don't want to hard
  code each of every parameter for my library. 
- I want the users to set parameters in a spring-boot like fashion  
```yaml
actor:
  pekko: 
    ... 
```

- As we might integrate other actor systems(such as Akka) in the future, let's add some prefix like `pekko` and `akka`
