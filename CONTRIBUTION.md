# Contributing to Spring Boot Starter Actor

Welcome to Spring Boot Starter Actor! This document outlines contribution areas and enhancement opportunities for the project.

## üéØ Priority Tasks

### High Priority
- [x] **Timeout Configuration Alignment** - Standardize timeout handling between SpringActorRef and SpringShardedActorRef
- [x] **Builder Pattern** - Implement builder pattern for actor ref initialization
- [x] **Type Safety** - Add stricter generic bounds and remove unchecked casts
- [x] **Direct Access** - Add getUnderlying() methods for advanced use cases

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Retry Mechanisms** - Implement retry policies with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Basic Metrics** - Add more pekko native metrics under metrics module. 

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Advanced Monitoring** - Grafana dashboards for pekko native metrics. 
- [ ] **Lifecycle Management** - Graceful shutdown and termination handling
- [ ] **Testing Utilities** - Test fixtures and mock actors
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker** - Resilience patterns implementation

## üèóÔ∏è Core Infrastructure

### Deployment & Scalability
- [ ] Blue-Green deployment example 
- [ ] Rolling Update support - app versioning, minimizing data loss etc 
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment templates and cluster formation

### Sharding & Distribution
- [ ] Custom sharding logic for even load distribution
- [ ] Affinity-based sharding for related entities
- [ ] Dynamic shard allocation based on metrics
- [ ] Shard rebalancing strategies for cluster changes

## üîß API Enhancements

```

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow existing patterns and conventions
   - Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments
   - Ensure type safety with proper generics
   - Write clean, testable code

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests for all new features
   - Integration tests for Spring Boot context
   - Performance tests for critical paths
   - Thread safety verification

3. **Pull Request Checklist**
   - [ ] Code follows project conventions
   - [ ] Tests pass locally
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Examples still work
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or properly documented)

## üìã Compatibility

### Version Support
- Spring Boot 2.x (core module)
- Spring Boot 3.x (core-boot3 module)
- Java 11+
- Apache Pekko (Akka fork)
